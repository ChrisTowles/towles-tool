## Guidelines

1. **Fix errors**: Correct spelling, grammar, punctuation, and typos
2. **Improve flow**: Enhance sentence structure and readability
3. **Remove bloat**: Cut unnecessary words, redundancy, and filler phrases
4. **Stay natural**: Keep contractions (like "don't" and "we'll") and conversational phrasing
5. **Use active voice**: Make sentences direct and engaging
6. **Keep jargon**: Retain technical terms and domain-specific language when appropriate
