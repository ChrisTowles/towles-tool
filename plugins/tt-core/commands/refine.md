 # Refine Text

  Improve the grammar, spelling, and wording of the selected text while maintaining:
  - **Conciseness**: Keep it brief and to the point
  - **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language
  - **Professional tone**: Semi-formal, appropriate for technical/business contexts

  ## Guidelines

  1. Fix spelling and grammar errors
  2. Improve sentence structure and flow
  3. Remove unnecessary words and redundancy
  4. Use active voice where appropriate
  5. Maintain the original meaning and intent
  6. Keep technical terms and jargon when contextually appropriate

  ## What NOT to do

  - Don't make it overly formal or stiff
  - Don't add unnecessary complexity or fancy words
  - Don't significantly expand the length
  - Don't change the core message or tone drastically
