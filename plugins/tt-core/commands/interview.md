description: Interview user to clarify requirements before building
---

## Context

When requirements are unclear, don't guess. Interview the user to understand what they want.

## Your Task

Ask focused questions to clarify:

1. **What** - What are we building? What problem does it solve?
2. **Why** - Why is this needed? What's the goal?
3. **How** - How should it work? What's the expected behavior?
4. **Where** - Where does it fit in the codebase/workflow?
5. **Constraints** - Any limitations, preferences, or must-haves?

## Guidelines

- Ask one question at a time
- Build on previous answers
- Summarize understanding before proceeding
- Don't start building until requirements are clear
- Keep questions short and direct

## Output

Once requirements are clear, summarize the plan and confirm before implementing.
