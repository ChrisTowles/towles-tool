# Jokes Command Requirements

## Overview

The `jokes` command provides a fun easter egg feature that displays 5 random programming and tech-related jokes to brighten the user's day. This command adds a lighthearted element to the CLI tool while maintaining the professional structure and patterns established in the codebase.

## Command Signature

```bash
# Display 5 random programming jokes
towles-tool jokes
```

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Joke Display
- **Random selection**: Display 5 jokes randomly selected from a collection of programming/tech jokes
- **Consistent format**: Present jokes in a numbered, well-formatted output
- **Tyler branding**: Include reference to "Tyler" in the output header as requested in the original issue
- **Emoji support**: Use appropriate emojis to enhance the visual presentation

### 2. Joke Collection
- **Programming focus**: All jokes should be related to programming, software development, or technology
- **Clean content**: All jokes should be workplace-appropriate and professional
- **Variety**: Maintain a collection of at least 10 jokes to ensure variety across multiple runs
- **Quality**: Jokes should be clever and relevant to the developer audience

### 3. Output Format
- **Header**: Styled header with "Tyler's Tech Joke Collection" branding
- **Numbering**: Each joke numbered 1-5 for easy reading
- **Footer**: Encouraging closing message
- **Colors**: Use consola colors for enhanced terminal presentation

### 4. Technical Requirements
- **No arguments**: Command takes no arguments or options
- **Error handling**: Graceful error handling with appropriate error messages
- **Debug support**: Respect the context debug flag for additional logging
- **Performance**: Instant execution with no external dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions
- `getRandomJokes()`: Returns array of 5 randomly selected jokes
- `formatJokeOutput()`: Formats jokes for terminal display
- `jokesCommand()`: Main command handler following established patterns

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all functions
- **Mock testing**: Proper mocking of consola for output testing
- **Error scenarios**: Test error handling and edge cases
- **Randomization**: Test that different jokes are returned on multiple calls

### Integration
- **Command registration**: Registered in parseArgs.ts following established patterns
- **Execution handler**: Added to main executeCommand switch statement
- **Type safety**: Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
