# Plan Start

Begin gathering requirements for: $ARGUMENTS

## Setup

Will create a plan folder and initial files to track the requirements and creating a plan to then follow.

1. Create timestamp-based folder: `docs/.plan/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[slug]`
2. Extract slug from $ARGUMENTS (e.g., "add user profile" â†’ "user-profile")
    - We refer to that folder as the "plan-folder"
3. Create initial files:
   - in the folder create file "plan.md" with the user's request.
   - we will refer to this file as "plan-file"
4. Read and update `docs/.plan/.current-plan` with folder name

## Explore

Use parallel subagents to find and read all files that may be useful for implementing the change, either as examples or as edit targets. The subagents should return relevant file paths, and any other info that may be useful.

- Identify key directories and files
- Look for existing features that are similar
- Identify core components, services, and utilities
- Use WebSearch and or context7 for best practices or library documentation
- This will help inform the questions we ask later

## Plan

Next, think hard and write up a detailed implementation plan. Don't forget to include tests, components, and documentation. Use your judgement as to what is necessary, given the standards of this repo.

If there are things you are not sure about, use parallel subagents to do some web research. They should only return useful information, no noise.

If there are things you still do not understand or questions you have for the user, pause here to ask them before continuing.

  - Generate the 3 to 5 of most important questions to understand the problem space:
   - Questions informed by codebase structure
   - Questions about user interactions and workflows
   - Questions about similar features users currently use
   - Questions about data/content being worked with
   - Questions about external integrations or third-party services
   - Questions about performance or scale expectations
   - Begin asking questions one at a time proposing the question with a smart default option
   - ONE question at a time
   - Only after all questions are asked, record answers in the plan-file under `discovery answers`


### Write the plan file

- Using the information gathered, write a detailed plan in the `plan-file`:
  - Problem statement
  - High-level solution overview
  - Initial thoughts on implementation
  - Any known constraints or requirements
  - Specific files that need modification
  - Exact patterns to follow
  - Similar features analyzed in detail
  - Technical constraints and considerations
  - Integration points identified
  - discovery answers
- Use actual file paths and component names in detail phase
- Document WHY each default makes sense
- Use tools available and ask before adding or installing more
  - Ask user to confirm if this is the right direction
Write initial plan to `docs/.plan/plan-[slug].md`:
    - ONLY yes/no questions with smart defaults


## Confirm

- Ask user to confirm if this plan is the right direction
- If user has questions or changes, update the plan-file accordingly.
- only proceed if user confirms the plan is correct

## Code

Read all the files in the plan-folder and use them to inform the implementation. 

- work through the plan step by step
- ask me to confirm after each step before proceeding
- write red/green unit tests first. 
    - Mock as little as possible. You will need to commit here using `git commit -m <message> --no-verify`in order commit them in without triggering pre-commit hooks.

- after each step commit your changes with a clear message
- If you need to make changes to the plan, do so in the plan-file and ask
- If you need to ask questions, do so in the plan-file and ask


### Post Steps

Generate comprehensive requirements spec in `/docs/requirements` folder

- Problem statement and solution overview
- Functional requirements based on all answers
- Technical requirements with specific file paths
- Implementation hints and patterns to follow
- Acceptance criteria
- Assumptions for any unanswered questions


## Phase Transitions

- After each phase, announce: "Phase complete. Starting [next phase]..."
- Save all work before moving to next phase
